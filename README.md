# WordCount Implementation

The source for this file can be seen in the wordcountjava/src folder, and the ready-to-use .jar can be found in the wordcountjava/target folder.  After creating an Azure cluster, upload the .jar to thru an SSH connection, then run the job with the `yarn jar <jar-filepath> <input-filepath> <output-filepath>` command.
